## About this Course

This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. 

You will learn about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. You will learn how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. You will also learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. You will utilize Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help you refine your skills for exploring and analyzing data. 

Finally, you will be required to use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate your results and findings.

If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge upon successful completion of the course.


## Syllabus

### WEEK 1

#### Introduction

* **Key Concepts**
    * Learn about the problem that you will be working on in this capstone course
    * Learn how to get started with Git and Github
    * Apply your data analysis and machine learning skills to solve a problem using real world data
    * Create a project on Watson Studio, create a project, start a notebook and share it with your peers

#### In this module, you will learn about the scope of this capstone course and the context of the project that you will be working on. You will learn about different location data providers and what location data is normally composed of. Finally, you will be required to submit a link to a new repository on your Github account dedicated to this course.

**Graded:** Capstone Project Notebook

### WEEK 2

#### Foursquare API

* **Key Concepts**
    * Learn about Foursquare and its API
    * Learn how to create a Foursquare developer account
    * Create a Foursquare developer account
    * Learn how to use the Foursquare API to search for a specific type of venues, explore a given venue, and search for trending venue around a location
    * Complete a lab to better understand how to make calls to the Foursquare API and retrieve location data from its database

#### In this module, you will learn in details about Foursquare, which is the location data provider we will be using in this course, and its API. Essentially, you will learn how to create a Foursquare developer account, and use your credentials to search for nearby venues of a specific type, explore a particular venue, and search for trending venues around a location.

**Graded:** Foursquare API

### WEEK 3

#### Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering

* **Key Concepts**
    * Hone your communication skills by documenting your work and submitting a full project report and a presentation or a blog post
    * Decide what is the suitable algorithm for the capstone project
    * Learn how to deal with missing attributes' values and imbalanced data
    * Learn about CRISP DM framework for machine Learning

#### In this module, you will learn about k-means clustering, which is a form of unsupervised learning. Then you will use clustering and the Foursquare API to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of New York. Furthermore, you will learn how to scrape website and parse HTML code using the Python package Beautifulsoup, and convert data into a pandas dataframe.

**Graded:** Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto

### WEEK 4

#### The Battle of Neighborhoods

* **Key Concepts**
    * Define a problem for your capstone project
    * Finding the data that you will use for the capstone project

#### In this module, you will start working on the capstone project. You will clearly define a problem and discuss the data that you will be using to solve the problem.

**Graded:** Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)

### WEEK 5

#### The Battle of Neighborhoods (Cont'd)

* **Key Concepts**
    * Carry out the remaining work to complete the capstone project
    * Submit a link to your project notebook and a complete project report

#### In this module, you will carry out all the remaining work to complete your capstone project. You will submit a report of your project for peer evaluation.

**Graded:** Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 2)
